## Transparent, open, and collaborative
ART aspires to be transparent, open, and collaborative. Most of our regular meetings are published in our team calendar and colleagues are welcome to attend. 

## Meeting policy
We try to remember to record each meeting. Recordings will be available in the meeting Teams chat in accordance with Microsoft’s retention policy.

We desire all meetings to be open. However, we recognize at times a meeting invitee may desire the meeting to be private. Meeting invitees may request meetings to be unrecorded and invitee-only at any time and without justification. ART’s policy is to honor this request.

## Types of meetings

* **Office Hours** – we will hold regular office hours for anyone in the organization to stop in and ask questions about ART or a project ART is working on. These will be announced in advance. 

* **Retrospective** – each project culminates with a retrospective meeting where we share the learnings and results with the organization.

* **Open Working Session** – as we are working on a project, team members are encouraged to schedule open working sessions. These are sessions where they will be working on a particular aspect of a project and invite collaborators to either observe and learn or participate if they have a particular skill in that area. Think of this as an internal Twitch for CSAs. 

* **Scrum** – the Scrum is our core process meeting where we review the status of each project (twice weekly.) Further explanation of the Scrum process is detailed under the Project life cycle heading.

* **Standups** – some projects require more direct attention and engagement then a Scrum provides for. For these types of projects, one-off standup meetings may be scheduled.

* **Engagement Request Review** – the ART Engagement Review Board holds a regular meeting to triage requests for the engagement of the ART team.
