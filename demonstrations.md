      Description from UG of what was done for data flow and data cleansing.
        Explain Data Flow / Ingestion stored in Parquet Data Lake / SQL DW Dedicated
        - PowerBI hits dedicated SQL Pool running 
        - More optimized for reporting and dashboarding
  
        - Serverless more suited for data scientest / adhoc data exploration

      Parquet - queries show serverless against lake

## 10 minute demonstration - SWITCH STORY TO IOT FOR MINES  (10 minutes)

  - Spark Serverless  (notebooks)

    - Cosmos DB Data Store

      iot FROM 1 MINE - SIMULATING 50 SENSORS THROUGH OUT THE MINE
      HAVE 1 OF THEM SPIKE

    - HTAP

    - Analytics and visualizations inside Synapse VIA SPARK
    - REFERENCE THAT WE COULD ALSO DO IN POWER BI (REMIND THEM OF WHAT THEY JUST SAW)
  
    - Anamoly Detector
